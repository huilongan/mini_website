  + Build Database 
    + Build the database by using sqlite3 in Python (Traditional relational database)
    + Write a class named 'minidatabase' to encapsulate query methods needed
    + Everytime just need to import recommender and connect to built database by minibase
  
  + Build Website using Flask Python
    + RESTful Based 
    + Request 'user_id' and other information from html and use ajax (based on javascript) for transfering information
  
  + Item based similarity recommendar  
  
     1. **Similarity computation:** This model computes the similarity between items using the observations of users who have interacted with both items.	For similarity here, we choose Cosine similarity, which is computed as:  .

    where Ui is the set of users who rated item i, and Uij is the set of users who rated both items i and j.  
    
    2. **Prediction generation:** If we target item j, given a similarity between items i and j, S(i,j), it scores an item j for user using a weighted average of user's previous observation ratings. Prediction for Item j is computed as:

  + Overview Statistics EDA
  
     + Visualizations of business data, user data and review data, including a worldwide map of user distribution, a detailed map of user distribution by city, an animated donut plot of register users by year, a bar plot of top5 cuisine type by city, a stacked plot of rating distribution by city, a correlation heatmap of review frequency and number of fans and an interactive chord diagram between type of votes and average review.
